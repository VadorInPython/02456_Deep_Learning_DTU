This is fairly easy to work with, will explain that below in a few steps.

## 1.Make sure you have Anaconda Navigator and Jupyter Notebook installed on your device (lately I found out you can open ipynb files with Visual Studio Code as well).
## 2. Just download any of the notebook's and place it wherever you'll have easy access to it, sometimes it may be needed to download whole files to make the whole notebooks usaeble.
## 3. Open the chosen notebook with Jupyter Notebook or VSC and either check it out or play along.

P.S. It may be worth installing CUDA, cause most of this stuff needs GPU support, just because the computation of such alghoritms is way better on it, however if you'd like to proceed with CPU it's fine as well.
